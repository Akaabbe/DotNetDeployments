# .NET Deployments
The goal of this open source project is to allow .NET developers to deploy .NET projects. This includes Windows Services (exe), ASP.NET MVC sites, Web Api, and WCF projects. Developers are more productive when they concentrate on code and logic not on deployment tasks. 

AWS CodeDeploy will serve as our deployment engine. It's capable of deploying code to AWS Instances (servers), and also on-premises servers. 

This project is built against .NET Core 2. .NET Core is cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

To get started with this project, you will need to [install .NET Core.](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
